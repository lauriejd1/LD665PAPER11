        "The CET time series is an extraordinary dataset—it's the _oldest_ continuous meteorological record in the world, stretching back to 1659!  It was produced by combining records from locations across central England; early records were from individual observers in larger cities like London, whilst later measurements came from government-provided weather stations across the region. The CET captures daily and monthly temperatures across a central region of England-long before modern climate monitoring began. Because of its long time span, the CET has been widely used by scientists and historians to study how historical weather patterns, seasonal variations, and longer-term climate has changed from the Little Ice Age into present.\n",

You can read more about Dr. Manley's CET efforts in the citations below.)\n",
